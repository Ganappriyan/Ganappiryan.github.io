              While all other the tribes took stone for hunting, India is a
              country where it used to sculpt, not only rich in Knowledge,
              Indian Art and Architecture express their love towards Mankind.

                There is a popular aphorism that depicts India’s linguistic
                diversity rather well: Kos-kos par badle paani, chaar kos par
                baani (The language spoken in India changes every few
                kilometres, just like the taste of the water). The Census of
                2001 provided only a partial demonstration of this multiplicity
                when it said that our country has 30 languages that are spoken
                by more than a million people each. These 30 languages by
                themselves only provide a linguistic window through which we can
                view the 122 languages that are spoken by at least 10,000 people
                each. Then we have the 1,599 languages, most of them dialects,
                restricted to specific regions, many of them on the verge of
                extinction.

                The Nāṭya Śāstra (Sanskrit: नाट्य शास्त्र, Nāṭyaśāstra) is a
                Sanskrit treatise on the performing arts. The text is attributed
                to sage Bharata Muni, and its first complete compilation is
                dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between
                500 BCE and 500 CE. The text consists of 36 chapters with a
                cumulative total of 6000 poetic verses describing performance
                arts. The subjects covered by the treatise include dramatic
                composition, structure of a play and the construction of a stage
                to host it, genres of acting, body movements, make up and
                costumes, role and goals of an art director, the musical scales,
                musical instruments and the integration of music with art
                performance.

                The Sushruta Samhita (सुश्रुतसंहिता, IAST: Suśrutasaṃhitā,
                literally "Suśruta's Compendium") is an ancient Sanskrit text on
                medicine and surgery, and one of the most important such
                treatises on this subject to survive from the ancient world. The
                Compendium of Suśruta is one of the foundational texts of
                Ayurveda (Indian traditional medicine), alongside the
                Caraka-Saṃhitā, the Bheḷa-Saṃhitā, and the medical portions of
                the Bower Manuscript. It is one of the two foundational Hindu
                texts on medical profession that have survived from ancient
                India.

                Indian musical instruments can be broadly classified according
                to the Hornbostel–Sachs system into four categories:
                chordophones (string instruments), aerophones (wind
                instruments), membranophones (drums) and idiophones (non-drum
                percussion instruments).

                Indian classical music is the classical music of the Indian
                subcontinent. It has two major traditions: the North Indian
                classical music tradition is called Hindustani, while the South
                Indian expression is called Carnatic. These traditions were not
                distinct until about the 15th century.

                The main aim of the artist is to create beauty and while working
                on a particular painting they keep that in mind. This is why the
                Indian arts have a distinct position in the global arena. As
                compared to other forms of art like dance and music, paintings
                are capable to portray the feelings and emotions of the artist
                for a longer period. In simple words, Indian paintings have the
                capability to portray human emotions and hold them for a longer
                period.

                Built by Raja Raja Chola I in 1010 AD, Brihadeshwara Temple is
                an ancient temple at Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu. His temple is a
                magnificent architectural construct that will never stop
                surprising anyone visiting the temple. Built using over 130,000
                tons of granite, this fabulous structure shows the architectural
                prowess and affinity of the South Indian kings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Important architectural feature of the temple is that the shadow

                Marked as one of the seven wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal
                was built by Shah Jahan, in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz
                Mahal, and was the best work ever produced by the Mughal
                architecture. Ustad Isa was the master architect under whose
                guidance this monument was designed, executed and completed. It
                is made of pure white marble and described as a 'dream in
                marble'. All its parts have a perfection in proportion. This
                structure on the bank of the river Jamuna is constructed on a
                platform 6.5 metres high. Some of its special features which
                make it a masterpiece in marble are the gateway, the central
                dome, the elegant minarets, the lovely gardens and the intricate
                inlay work on marble.

                The Statue of Unity is built in dedication to Iron Man Sardar
                Vallabhbhai Patel, who served as the first home minister of
                independent India. At 182 metre, the statue is 23 metre taller
                than China's Spring Temple Buddha statue and almost double the
                height of the Statue of Liberty (93 metre tall) in US.
